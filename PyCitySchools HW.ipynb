    "This is the notebook for the analysis of the district of the schools.  I analyzed first the district, then the summary of schools, and then segmented some data to see top and worst performing schools, and the performance by grade of the students.  Finally there is an analysis by type of school and by size and budget amounts assigned to each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have some observable trends based on the data analyzed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Of all the schools analyzed, the average in mathematics and the average in reading is similar, however, the average in mathematics is always lower in all than reading average.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In schools with the highest budget, grades are lower, both in math and in reading. The best in performance are all Charter schools, the worst are all Distric type schools. In the worst the average of mathematics is much lower than that of reading that is regular, in the best schools, the averages between both are similar, being a little higher the reading as I already mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is also an interesting trend, the largest schools in size (> 2000 students) have very low performance, the best have a size less than this number except one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Students who have an assigned budget over the amount of 615 lower their grades in both math and reading, and the worsts are those with the highest budget allocations, between 645 and 675.\n"
